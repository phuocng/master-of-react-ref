# Master of React ref

React Ref is a fantastic feature in React that allows you to directly access and manipulate DOM (Document Object Model) elements.
In simpler terms, it's a way to reference a specific element in your React app, giving you the power to modify and interact with it outside of the normal React data flow.

This series is your ultimate guide to mastering the use of ref in React.
We'll start with the basics, such as string and callback ref, and then dive into more advanced topics like the `useRef()` hook and `forwardRef()` API.
By the end, you'll have a deep understanding of how to use ref like a pro in your React applications.
Get ready to take your React skills to the next level!
